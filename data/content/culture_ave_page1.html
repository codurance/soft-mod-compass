    <p>It seems that there may be a broadly-accepted desire to be transparent in your organisation, but some execution is lacking (perhaps for historical reasons). Typically in this scenario, we find a request-response model of information flow which requires employees to actively seek out information.</p>
    <p>Team skill levels may be holding your organisation's progress back and a restrictive training budget may exacerbate this situation. An expectation or reliance on staff members learning in their own time will also hold teams back from achieving to their maximum potential.</p>
    <p>There is generally no direct punishment for failure, but neither are failures examined and treated as learning opportunities.</p>
    <p>Career paths may be defined and are perhaps highly competitive. Career opportunities may be limited by the need for a position to open up and individual progression may be capped for those who are not interested in moving into management positions.</p>
    <p>A sense of frustration over the difficulty of obtaining supposedly open information leads to employees simply not bothering to search for it. This can lead to mistakes owing to misinformed people and non-deliberate information hiding. Information sharing requests may at best be treated with low priority, while at worst they may fall on deaf ears.</p>
    <p>A lack of training leads to a lack of specialists and a general sense of lethargy regarding self- and organisational improvement. Highly driven employees, lacking assistance to help them achieve mastery, will disengage and seek out alternative employment at organisations that have a culture of learning.</p>
    <p>A culture of hiding or misrepresenting failures (individual and organisational) results in the same mistakes being repeated over and over, when a culture of honest feedback and learning would have corrected the root cause.</p>
    <p>One of the greatest dangers of a glass ceiling (especially for those who do not wish to pursue careers in management) is the loss of your most senior people. If it is easier to progress by leaving the organisation then your competitors will gladly hire your best technical staff members.</p>
    <p>Find transparency bottlenecks and actively remove them - speak to your employees to understand what is blocking their access to information. Work on moving towards a publish-subscribe model of information dissemination.</p>
    <p>Set aside budget for training and optimise and encourage a culture of learning. Consider kicking off initiatives such as lunch-and-learns, open spaces, unconferences and company-supported learning time. Make sure that your training initiatives are directed towards learnings that improve both employee knowledge and capability..</p>
    <p>Put an emphasis on incident retrospectives and root-cause analysis. Make sure that you have constructive feedback mechanisms in place that emphasise learning and continuous improvement rather than blame and punishment.</p>
    <p>Clarify the career development path for every role in your organisation. Make sure to remove progression bottlenecks and to understand each individual's career goals and aspirations. Ensure that your progression plans allow technical people to progress as far as non-technical people.</p>
