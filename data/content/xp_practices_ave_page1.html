    <p>It appears that your organisation has made an effort to adopt XP practices but that currently adoption is uneven and inconsistent and/or you a struggling to kick on to the next level in order to start seeing the big payoffs. While test-driven development is used sporadically, it's probably more common for teams to write unit tests after writing production code and most legacy code is probably still dependent on manual acceptance testing. Your teams are refactoring, but rather that refactoring as they go it's likely that tend to allow technical debt to accumulate for a while before tackling it in a large batch. They may also struggle to effectively apply the XP practices to legacy code.</p>
    <p>Your teams normally work at a sustainable pace, possibly with occasional short bursts of overtime to try to resolve specific issues. There is likely a peer review process in place, but peer reviews are sporadic and/or inconsistent across the organisation. Generally speaking, your developers do not pair program unless the task at hand is especially complex or time critical.</p>
    <p>Things are going relatively well, but you are coming under increasing pressure to reduce the amount of time it takes to bring features to market as opportunities are being missed and its taking too long to get feedback from customers.</p>
