    <p>Your organisation is much more of a leader than a follower. Our first recommendation would be to share your experience and knowledge with the wider community by hosting events, writing blog posts and encouraging your team members to speak at events organised by others.</p>
    <p>Encourage your teams to experiment. Use techniques like 20% time and hack days to find new ways of working, new feature ideas and maybe even new product ideas.</p>
    <p>Where it is appropriate, consider whether you can export the principles that underlie XP into other parts of your organisation to help them to improve.</p>
