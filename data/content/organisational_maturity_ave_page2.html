    <p>Try combining people with responsibility for customers, development, security and operations into cross-functional delivery teams. Ensuring that all of the knowledge and skills required are within the team will eliminate delays in acquiring information and significantly reduce the risk of miscommunication as teams build a shared understanding together.</p>
    <p>Focus on discovering the value of features and projects as early as possible. Ensure that you have actionable metrics which you can use to measure the value delivered and use that feedback to inform further development. Try forming hypotheses about the potential value of features and use experiments to test them.</p>
    <p>Provide training and coaching in practices like continuous refactoring and simple design to your developers to help slow or eliminate the creation of defects and reckless technical debt. Get used to controlling the scope of products, features and releases to achieve desired timescales, rather than letting schedule pressure force quality down and technical debt up.</p>
