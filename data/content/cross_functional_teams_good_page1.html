    <p>Teams and individuals within your organisation are highly autonomous with a high level of trust between them. Your teams are fully cross-functional; their capability spans both technical and business specialisations and they regularly and consistently deliver high value software. Technical and business knowledge is well distributed throughout the organisation. Your team members are a diverse group of people with experience of many different industries, organisation types and skills.</p>
    <p>Technical and process decisions are made by people with the best information and experience to make them. Teams have the autonomy to choose the best tools for the job at hand. As a consequence, job satisfaction and staff retention are high and your organisation is recognised as a desirable place to work.</p>
    <p>Your teams have few if any external dependencies that have the potential to impede delivery, and team members have confidence that their colleagues will support them by doing an excellent job.</p>
    <p>The combination of a motivated group of people with a variety of backgrounds and experiences who can choose the tools and technologies they want to work with leads to a culture of innovation that positively impacts your organisation's products.</p>
    <p>Consider contributing your experiences building your organisation to the wider community by speaking at events or publishing blog posts, papers or books.</p>
    <p>Experiment with turning internal products managed by an autonomous team into a product that can be taken to market and generate revenue.</p>
    <p>Encourage the development of T-shaped team members, giving the opportunity for motivated team members to diversify their skills into new disciplines.</p>
