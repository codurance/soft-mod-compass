    <p>It appears that you may be working in the classical “siloed” team approach, where teams and external stakeholders are not working in harmony. At this maturity level, politics and career-driven decision making can often have negative consequences on productivity and profitability. Common symptoms include a growing technical debt backlog with no clear plan to address it and a lack of understanding amongst developers as to why they are implementing certain features and changes. A culture of blame emerges, resulting in a loss of learnings from mistakes.    </p>
    <p>A common consequence of the silo-ing of technical teams is a lack of consideration given to operational and security requirements during the development cycle. This can lead to an inability to detect, monitor and resolve issues in production systems without extensive investigation and rework. Your risk of data breaches and system compromisation (along with related reputational and financial risks) is also greatly increased if the strength of your security systems are not considered early on in the software development lifecycle.</p>
    <p>Over and above bug-tracking and security issues, at this stage of maturity it is common to find teams building the wrong thing owing to a lack of communication and little to no understanding of business goals. Teams will build products that don’t provide real customer value (even if it seems as if the development effort was successful), thus wastefully utilising expensive resources.</p>
    <p>An extremely common consequence of low organisational maturity is constantly increasing/unpredictable developmenttimelines, with lowered quality levels owing to a big rush during the final push to release. Once this culture of rushing has established itself it is common to find chaotic codebases where changes cannot be made without introducing defects in unrelated areas of the codebase, alongside long lists of obsolete and unsupported dependencies.</p>
    <p>At this stage, your best bet is to weaken organisational silos - ensure that representatives from the business, development, operations and security teams are well represented in the software development lifecycle, and that they meet early and often. Bringing the teams together and ensuring that they have a common understanding of requirements (both functional and non-functional) leads to a more efficient, cohesive workforce. You may wantto create space for teams to meet and understand each others methodologies and challenges, and perhaps document some of these issues (along with possible remedies).</p>
    <p>Additionally, it is important to create an understanding across all teams of the dangers of technical debt and its effects. We recommend kicking off a technical debt discovery process which involves locating and describing technical debt, describing the effects it has on both people and productivity, and making sure that your findings are transparent across all areas of the business. A drive to minimize the main areas of debt may seem like a massive effort, but it will pay dividends in ensuring future delivery speed and platform reliability.</p>
