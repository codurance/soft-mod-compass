    <p>To prevent defects from making it into production environments, we recommend creating a culture of quality, including training your development teams in Extreme Programming practices such as test-driven development. You will need to ensure that you have created a permissive environment for developers to both learn and apply these practices. Combine this with your automated deployment processes so that a full suite of tests is automatically run every time a code check-in occurs or a deployment is kicked off.</p>
