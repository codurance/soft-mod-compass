    <p>It is likely that your operations and security teams are involved in your software development life cycle, but they are still treated as external stakeholders by your development teams.</p>
    <p>Organisational politics probably has some influence on decision making across the development process. Some decisions are not being made in the best interest of the wider organisation, but rather in the best interest of individuals, departments or teams.</p>
    <p>You may find that technical debt levels are continuing to grow and that this is starting to have a direct impact on effective delivery. However, you are unable to bring it under control owing to schedule pressure, the necessary skills or difficulty quantifying the harm it is doing to the organisation to justify the time and effort.</p>
    <p>Key requirements from external stakeholders often arrive late, from the development team's perspective, and are sometimes misunderstood. Unfortunately, the only thing that is predictable about development lead times is that they are currently too long.</p>
    <p>You are still able to produce good work, but not in a sustainable fashion that keeps all stakeholders happy over the long term. Despite starting promisingly with quick initial progress, defect counts in your products are starting to rise thanks to increasing demand for features and misinterpreted requirements. This is starting to impact on the perception of your products which, while are currently performing well, could be vulnerable to disruption from more agile competitors in the near future.</p>
    <p>Try combining people with responsibility for customers, development, security and operations into cross-functional delivery teams. Ensuring that all of the knowledge and skills required are within the team will eliminate delays in acquiring information and significantly reduce the risk of miscommunication as teams build a shared understanding together.</p>
    <p>Focus on discovering the value of features and projects as early as possible. Ensure that you have actionable metrics which you can use to measure the value delivered and use that feedback to inform further development. Try forming hypotheses about the potential value of features and use experiments to test them.</p>
