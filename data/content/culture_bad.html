    <p>It appears that your organisational transparency is limited. People will feel as if they aren’t aware of what’s going on, why it is going on and who is driving it, and will find it hard to obtain relevant information to get their jobs done.</p>
    <p>Internal politics lead to employees playing the blame game and a tendency to cover up mistakes. The constant need to put a spin on everything you say and do leads to a toxic culture, rather than one of growth.</p>
    <p>There is a feeling of stagnation as employees cannot take advantage of new technology or ideas (either because they are not allowed to, or because noone is actively investigating them).</p>
    <p>In this scenario, career progression often appears to be impossible, and career paths are either not available or are arbitrarily defined.</p>
    <p>Waste, rework, delays to decision making and incorrect decisions being made are common consequences at this stage. Colleagues don’t trust one another and will perform their duties in a way that either benefits them, or protects their own interests.</p>
    <p>A lack of innovation leads to stagnation - motivated employees in this scenario tend to become disillusioned and to leave, this further stagnating any semblance of evolution.</p>
    <p>A fear of failure (and the related consequences) leads to risk-averse behaviour. Employees would rather do the minimum to cover themselves, and feel a lack of psychological safety when openly discussing even a small failing. This means that it is not possible to learn from your own failures, or those of others.</p>
    <p>Glass ceiling scenarios lead to retention issues, where highly motivated employees leave for greener pastures and those left behind are either of unchanging or decreasing value to the organisation.</p>
    <p>Work towards a situation of psychological safety and trust, where teams feel comfortable sharing goals and experiences. Consider creating safe spaces for people to give their feedback without judgement or retribution. Find your toxic employees and work with them towards resolving their issues - listen to their issues and understand the root cause of their attitudes.</p>
    <p>Understand and define on which axis you need to train your people. Incentivise training and encourage employee-lead learning initiatives during office hours. This includes allowing employees to be open and honest when discussing their mistakes in order to collaboratively resolve and learn from them.</p>
    <p>Define high-level roles and responsibilities for each role, and make sure that mentors are available to help your people to improve and progress. This will give your employees an idea of what is required to progress up the ranks, as well as a chance to mentor those who are looking to progress.</p>
