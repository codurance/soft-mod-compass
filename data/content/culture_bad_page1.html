    <p>It appears that your organisational transparency is limited. People feel as if they aren't aware of what's going on, why it is going on and who is calling the shots. They find it hard to obtain relevant information to get their jobs done.</p>
    <p>Internal politics lead to employees playing the blame game and a tendency to cover up mistakes out of fear of retribution or embarrassment. The constant need to put a spin on everything you say and do leads to a toxic culture, rather than one of growth.</p>
    <p>In this scenario, career progression often appears to be impossible, and career paths are either not realistically achievable or are arbitrarily defined.</p>
    <p>Waste, rework, delays, and bad decisions are common and accepted. Colleagues don't trust one another and will perform their duties in a way that either benefits them or protects their own interests.</p>
    <p>There is a feeling of stagnation as employees cannot take advantage of new technology or ideas (either because they are not allowed to, or because no one is actively investigating them). A lack of innovation leads to stagnation and intrinsically motivated employees tend to become disillusioned and to leave.</p>
    <p>A fear of failure and the related consequences contributes to risk-averse behaviour. Employees would rather do the minimum amount of work required to cover themselves, and feel a lack of psychological safety which prevents openly discussing even a small failing. This makes it impossible for the wider organisation to learn from mistakes and improve.</p>
    <p>Limited options for career progression leads to retention issues, where highly motivated employees leave for greener pastures and those left behind are either of unchanging or decreasing value to the organisation.</p>
    <p>Work towards an environment of psychological safety and trust, where teams feel comfortable sharing goals and experiences. Consider creating safe spaces for people to give their feedback without judgement or retribution.</p>
    <p>Understand and define on which axis you need to train your people. Incentivise training and encourage employee-lead learning initiatives during working hours. This includes allowing employees to be open and honest when discussing their mistakes in order to collaboratively learn from them and move past them.</p>
