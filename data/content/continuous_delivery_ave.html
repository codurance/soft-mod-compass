    <p>At this level we typically find that deployment processes are either entirely or mostly manual, and that there tends to be a blurred line of accountability between operations and development teams. Deployments to non-production environments are often automated, but production deployments remain manual.</p>
    <p>A large percentage of development time is spent reworking defects that escape into the production environment, pulling developersâ€™ attention away from newer, valuable components and features. This leads to risk-aversity amongst developers owing to unpredictable side effects.</p>
    <p>Deployment issues (and even full deployment failures) owing to human error are commonplace - important things may get missed or omitted owing to fuzzy accountability between development and operations teams. </p>
    <p>Deployment issues and rollbacks typically lead to a lower deployment cadence and slower time to market. When promised features fail top appear to clients, reputational damage follows and clients may look to other vendors to meet their needs.</p>
    <p>The combination of defect resolution and slow feature development lead times inevitably increases the cost of getting new features to market owing to fear-based over-engineering and risk-aversity in development teams. This frustration is a typical cause of developer frustration and a common reason for developers choosing to seek alternative employment.</p>
    <p>Spend the time to focus on deployment and delivery automation, especially for production deployments. You should choose a continuous delivery strategy that is appropriate to your current situation and implement it in collaboration with your development and operations teams. At this point you should be aiming for the ability to both deploy easily (and to roll back easily if something goes wrong). A focus on resilience and disaster recovery is recommended here.</p>
    <p>In addition, perform an incident retrospective and a root cause analysis every time you need to re-work something, and fix the root issue so that it cannot occur again. Make sure that these issues and fixes are logged and visible, and are part of your continuous deployment strategy. You should make sure that all environments (from developer machines upwards) mirror your production environment as closely as possible.</p>
    <p>Train and mentor your developers in test-driven development in order to minimize the risk of defects being created in the first place. Demonstrate to them how a good suite of unit, acceptance and smoke tests can give them the confidence they need to make required changes. You should foster and encourage a culture of technical quality, driven by tests.</p>
