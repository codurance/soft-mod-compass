    <p>At this stage, all information in the organisation should be available and easily accessible to all employees. A publish subscribe model should be in place where employees can choose which aspects of the organisation they want to keep up with.</p>
    <p>Training is regular and available to people as and when they need it. Your people are taking initiative to get involved in knowledge sharing both internally and externally.</p>
    <p>People are open about their failures and what they learnt from them. They disseminate this information freely to help others to avoid making the same mistakes. There is a culture of psychological safety across the whole organisation.</p>
    <p>The organisation has well-defined and well-understood career paths and people are encouraged to support each other in walking these paths and achieving their goals.</p>
    <p>Your people are happy and collaborate openly. They are comfortable with giving and receiving feedback and disseminating information at any level in the organisation.</p>
    <p>The drive for training and self-improvement nurtures highly motivated, innovative employees. Staff retention is excellent and people apply to your organisation in particular when seeking new opportunities.</p>
    <p>There is a culture of trust, and no fear of experimentation in new approaches and thinking. Staff retention is excellent and you end up growing highly-skilled and capable teams.</p>
    <p>Take your culture of openness and learning to the next level by becoming a significant contributor to the community. Both individuals and other organisations can benefit from your hard earned knowledge and experience, and your organisation will gain a reputation as both a thought-leader and a great place to work.</p>
    <p>You could use some of your training budget to bring in specialists and thought-leaders to train or coach your people. If you have these specialists in-house you could either sell or open-source your training materials.</p>
    <p>The next step in advancing your people is to design career paths to help people first, rather than to fulfill specific company needs.</p>
