    <p>Your organisation probably suffers from a silo mentality, where different teams do not want to share knowledge with others. Company politics and selfish decision making are having negative consequences on delivery, profitability and culture. Development teams are struggling with rapidly rising technical debt and a lack of understanding of the business value of the features they build. As a result there is a lack of trust between teams and stakeholders, and a culture of blame and recrimination.</p>
    <p>Thanks to silo'd teams and other communication problems, important stakeholders such as security and operations, are not involved in the development process until far too late. You probably don't have the ability to properly monitor, detect and resolve issues in production systems without extensive investigation and testing. Because the efficacy of your security is not considered early on in the software development lifecycle, you have no idea of how vulnerable your organisation is to attack from hackers, phishers and other malicious actors, nor do you have systems in place to help detect compromised systems. There is a good chance that the first place where you will hear of a security breach at your organisation is in the news.</p>
    <p>Your leadership responds to your unpredictable development timelines with a "crunch" period in the run-up to an important milestone. This schedule pressure drives down the quality of your work, increases technical debt and leads to a vicious cycle as deadlines are missed and the process begins anew.</p>
    <p>In addition to quality, delivery and security problems, your organisation could well be frantically building the wrong products thanks to fractured communication between warring teams and general confusion about business goals. All too often when a product is finally delivered it does not satisfy customer needs and does not provide real business value.</p>
    <p>You need to break down the barriers that are hindering information and knowledge sharing. Ensure that representatives from the business, development, operations and security teams are involved early and often in the software development life cycle. Try to bring fractured teams together and ensure that they are aligned to your organisation's goals first and foremost, and have a shared understanding that they all succeed or fail together.  You may want to create space for teams to meet and understand each other's skills, approaches and challenges, and perhaps collaborate on improvements. This will lead to a more effective, cohesive workforce.</p>
    <p>Additionally it is important to create an understanding across all teams of costs of poor quality and the ensuing technical debt. We recommend kicking off a technical debt discovery process which involves identifying and describing technical debt, describing the effects it has on both people and business goals, and making sure that the findings are transparent across all areas of the business.</p>
    <p>Prioritising technical debt and addressing the areas that are causing you the most immediate problems will be difficult, but will pay dividends in ensuring future delivery speed and reliability.</p>
