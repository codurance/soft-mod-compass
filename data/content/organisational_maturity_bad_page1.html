    <p>Your organisation probably suffers from a silo mentality, where different teams do not want to share knowledge with others. Company politics and selfish decision making are having negative consequences on delivery, profitability and culture. Development teams are struggling with rapidly rising technical debt and a lack of understanding of the business value of the features they build. As a result there is a lack of trust between teams and stakeholders, and a culture of blame and recrimination.</p>
    <p>Thanks to silo'd teams and other communication problems, important stakeholders such as security and operations, are not involved in the development process until far too late. You probably don't have the ability to properly monitor, detect and resolve issues in production systems without extensive investigation and testing.</p>
    <p>Because the efficacy of your security is not considered early on in the software development lifecycle, you have no idea of how vulnerable your organisation is to attack from hackers, phishers and other malicious actors, nor do you have systems in place to help detect compromised systems. There is a good chance that the first place where you will hear of a security breach at your organisation is in the news.</p>
    <p>Your leadership responds to your unpredictable development timelines with a "crunch" period in the run-up to an important milestone. This schedule pressure drives down the quality of your work, increases technical debt and leads to a vicious cycle as deadlines are missed and the process begins anew.</p>
