    <p>Spend some time focusing on deployment and delivery automation, especially for production deployments. You should make sure that all environments replicate your production environment as closely as practical. Choose a continuous delivery strategy that is appropriate to your current situation and implement it in collaboration with your development and operations teams. You should be aiming for the ability to both deploy easily and to recover easily if something goes wrong.</p>
    <p>In addition, every time you experience defects, issues or other failures you should be performing an incident retrospective with a focus on root cause analysis. The outcome should result in a fix of the root cause so that it cannot occur again. Make sure that these issues and fixes are logged and visible.</p>
    <p>Train and mentor your developers in Extreme Programming practices in order to minimise the risk of defects being introduced in the first place. Demonstrate to them how a good suite of unit, acceptance and smoke tests can give them the confidence they need to make required changes. You should foster and encourage a culture of technical quality, driven by tests.</p>
