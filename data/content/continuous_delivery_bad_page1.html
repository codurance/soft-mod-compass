    <p>Your ability to get changes and new features into the hands of your users quickly and confidently is probably compromised. Finding defects in production environments results in a major emergency, with frantic rework and long deployments required before they are resolved. Compounding this, the manual deployment process itself is error prone and largely unrepeatable.</p>
    <p>Individuals in these kind of environments are often very risk averse, and lack the confidence to get feature releases and defect fixes built and deployed quickly.</p>
    <p>Team members are scared to touch existing systems for fear of both breaking them, and the amount of extra work they will have to put in to resolve unintended side effects. This leads to missed opportunities owing to slow time to market and major reputational damage from defects that leak into production and cannot be rapidly fixed or rolled back.</p>
    <p>You also open yourself up to both financial and contractual risk, as high-impact defects which have a direct, negative effect on your customers are shipped to production systems. You will find that recovery from these situations is hard to manage and largely unrepeatable.</p>
    <p>Financially, wasted time and resources (as well as missed business goals) owing to slow processes add a burden to your bottom line. You will probably find the need to employ large, expensive, slow-moving quality-assurance teams to ensure that defects don't slip through the cracks.</p>
    <p>A good first step is to allocate the time and resources to create an integration testing environment that mirrors your production environment as closely as possible. Foster a culture of collaboration and mutual understanding between operations and development team members by bringing them together to build this environment.</p>
    <p>Analyse and understand you existing deployment processes and to choose an automation toolset that is most compatible with them. Run a feasibility study on the use of cloud-based solutions for this purpose, and eventually for replacing any on-premises hosting infrastructure.</p>
    <p>To prevent defects from making it into production environments, we recommend creating a culture of quality, including training your development teams in Extreme Programming practices such as test-driven development. You will need to ensure that you have created a permissive environment for developers to both learn and apply these practices. Combine this with your automated deployment processes so that a full suite of tests is automatically run every time a code check-in occurs or a deployment is kicked off.</p>
