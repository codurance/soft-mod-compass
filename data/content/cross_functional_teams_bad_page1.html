    <p>It appears that your organisation places little to no value on the idea of cross-functional teams. Teams are probably organised by function and are probably behaving as "silos" where collaboration and information sharing is rare or non-existent. When information sharing is attempted it is heavily dependant on extensive documentation and formalised meetings over informal face-to-face communication.</p>
    <p>Management probably has a very hierarchical, command and control style, possibly extending to the micromanagement of teams and individual contributors. This will likely include very strict constraints on how teams organise to do their work and what tools and technology they are able to use.</p>
    <p>Teams are made up of individuals with very narrow specialisations and their productivity depends on all team members being available to do their specialist work. It is also possible that your teams are very homogeneous, consisting of individuals with a very similar background, training, views and experience.</p>
    <p>Interactions between teams and individuals in different silos are adversarial rather than collaborative, with each silo focusing on what it considers to be its goals rather than the wider goals of the organisation. In the worse case you may have teams or departments that treat each other as the enemy or as competition. You may also suffer from a lack of accountability as the responsibility for some goals or actions falls into the cracks between the silos.</p>
    <p>As your teams are probably organised along functional lines there are many handoffs of work between these teams (for example a Development Team handing off to a QA Team when they are "code complete" who then handoff to an Operations Team for deployment when the code is tested). Each handoff has the potential to introduce delays, miscommunication, relearning and potentially becomes a flash point for confrontation in an especially dysfunctional organisation.</p>
    <p>The process, tooling and technological constraints placed on teams by management damage motivation by removing autonomy and limit the capacity for innovation. This effect can be greatly exaggerated in a homogenous organisation.</p>
    <p>A lack of knowledge sharing and collaboration leads to unnecessary delays, defects and rework as key information is not available to the people who need it, when they need it. This is exacerbated when workflow is constrained by employees waiting for key knowledge or stakeholders to become available.</p>
    <p>The heavy specialisation in your existing teams leads to huge drops in productivity as the remaining team members are unable to cover the work of team members who are unavailable due to annual leave, sick leave or even leaving the organisation.</p>
    <p>Consider making changes to your recruitment process to identify and hire team members with experience of different industries, working methods, technologies and specialisations with the goal of creating diversity of thought within the organisation.</p>
    <p>Take steps to break down silos and encourage knowledge sharing between teams. Try having teams deliver workshops on their specialisation to others, or temporary team member exchanges to build a shared understanding of how the entire organisation works.</p>
    <p>Ensure that the goals and metrics of the various teams are aligned to the organisation's overall goals and that you are not accidentally creating Perverse Incentives for some teams. For example, an Operations team might be measured by the uptime of services or the number of reported incidents. This could incentivise the team to value stability to the detriment of other teams who are trying to regularly deliver value with new software.</p>
    <p>Encourage face-to-face communication, using conference and video calls if necessary. Place less importance on comprehensive documentation and tools like document management systems. Consider using tools like Wikis and chat applications to make documentation more collaborative when it is necessary.</p>
    <p>Coach your leaders and managers away from the command and control style of management towards the servant leadership style.</p>
