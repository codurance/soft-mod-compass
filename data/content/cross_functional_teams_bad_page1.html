    <p>It appears that your organisation places little to no value on the idea of cross-functional teams. Teams are probably organised by function and are probably behaving as "silos" where collaboration and information sharing is rare or non-existent. When information sharing is attempted it is heavily dependant on extensive documentation and formalised meetings over informal face-to-face communication.</p>
    <p>Management probably has a very hierarchical, command and control style, possibly extending to the micromanagement of teams and individual contributors. This will likely include very strict constraints on how teams organise to do their work and what tools and technology they are able to use.</p>
    <p>Teams are made up of individuals with very narrow specialisations and their productivity depends on all team members being available to do their specialist work. It is also possible that your teams are very homogeneous, consisting of individuals with a very similar background, training, views and experience.</p>
    <p>Interactions between teams and individuals in different silos are adversarial rather than collaborative, with each silo focusing on what it considers to be its goals rather than the wider goals of the organisation. In the worse case you may have teams or departments that treat each other as the enemy or as competition. You may also suffer from a lack of accountability as the responsibility for some goals or actions falls into the cracks between the silos.</p>
