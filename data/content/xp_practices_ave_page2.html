    <p>While product quality is generally pretty good, you have a nagging feeling that defects are making it to production more frequently than they should. When this happens, the time to fix can be long which damages the customer's perception of your products and your organisation. It's possible that, in an attempt to fix these issues, there is a large QA effort prior to release to catch defects. This QA effort is expensive due to the number of people involved and has the unfortunate side effect of increasing time to market due to the long cycle time of the QA process.</p>
    <p>Your organisation probably doesn't rely on overtime to ship features but the occasional need for overtime could still be damaging to team morale, especially if it happens at short notice. In the worst case, overtime policies could be creating Perverse Incentives that are an active hindrance to improvement.</p>
    <p>We recommend defining a test automation strategy, the goal of which should be to replace the vast majority of any existing manual testing. This should be achieved with appropriately scoped automated tests and a re-focus of manual testing on inventive, creative tasks like test design and exploratory testing.</p>
    <p>Change the emphasis from training developers on the practices of test-driven development, refactoring, simple design and pair programming to coaching your developers to effectively employ these practices in their day to day work in their current projects. Build a shared understanding of what "good" looks like in your organisation, so that the same standards are applied across your organisation when pair programming or other forms of peer review.</p>
    <p>If your organisation has a large legacy code base it would be wise to develop some architectural principles and possibly a redesigned architecture to give your development teams a target to aim for when they are refactoring.</p>
    <p>Continue to strive for continuous improvement. When defects are discovered and fixed in production be sure to conduct a retrospective and use root cause analysis to try to uncover the true cause of the defect being shipped. You should then to take actions to improve process and practices to prevent a reoccurance. Similarly, following the use of overtime to hit a goal, use root cause analysis to try and discover why overtime was necessary and prevent the need for it in similar circumstances in the future.</p>
