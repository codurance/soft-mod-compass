    <p>First of all you need to identify the areas where legacy code, weak development practices and overall low quality are hurting your organisation the most, so that remediation efforts can be focused where they will bring the most immediate benefit.</p>
    <p>You also need to ensure that the entire organisation is aware of the consequences of the current approach to software development and is committed to continuous improvement in general, and to employing XP practices specifically to improve the software development effort.</p>
    <p>Start training existing team members in the most urgent areas of the organisation on test-driven development, Refactoring and Simple Design. The initial goal of this training should be to ensure that all new code in these key areas is well designed with good test coverage to stabilise the current development process and break the current downward spiral. We would also suggest that team members in the most critical areas start pairing on tasks as soon as possible with the goal of ensuring that business critical knowledge is shared and teams are not dependent on the knowledge of a single individual.</p>
    <p>If there is a culture of excessive overtime or "crunching" then we recommend that you start addressing it by placing a hard limit on the number of hours that can be worked in a two week period and ensuring that all overtime is compensated with equivalent time off in lieu. Our goal is to reduce pressure on team members and to prevent overtime being used as a stop gap solution to deeper problems.</p>
