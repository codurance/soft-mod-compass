    <p>Work towards an environment of psychological safety and trust, where teams feel comfortable sharing goals and experiences. Consider creating safe spaces for people to give their feedback without judgement or retribution.</p>
    <p>Understand and define on which axis you need to train your people. Incentivise training and encourage employee-lead learning initiatives during working hours. This includes allowing employees to be open and honest when discussing their mistakes in order to collaboratively learn from them and move past them.</p>
    <p>Define responsibilities for each role, and make sure that mentors are available to help your people to improve and progress. This will give your team members an idea of what is required to progress up the ranks, as well as a chance to mentor those who are looking to progress.</p>
