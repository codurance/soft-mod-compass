    <p>In addition to quality, delivery and security problems, your organisation could well be frantically building the wrong products thanks to fractured communication between warring teams and general confusion about business goals. All too often when a product is finally delivered it does not satisfy customer needs and does not provide real business value.</p>    
    <p>You need to break down the barriers that are hindering information and knowledge sharing. Ensure that representatives from the business, development, operations and security teams are involved early and often in the software development life cycle. Try to bring fractured teams together and ensure that they are aligned to your organisation's goals first and foremost, and have a shared understanding that they all succeed or fail together.  You may want to create space for teams to meet and understand each other's skills, approaches and challenges, and perhaps collaborate on improvements. This will lead to a more effective, cohesive workforce.</p>
    <p>Additionally it is important to create an understanding across all teams of costs of poor quality and the ensuing technical debt. We recommend kicking off a technical debt discovery process which involves identifying and describing technical debt, describing the effects it has on both people and business goals, and making sure that the findings are transparent across all areas of the business.</p>
    <p>Prioritising technical debt and addressing the areas that are causing you the most immediate problems will be difficult, but will pay dividends in ensuring future delivery speed and reliability.</p>
