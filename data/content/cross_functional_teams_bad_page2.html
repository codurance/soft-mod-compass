    <p>Ensure that the goals and metrics of the various teams are aligned to the organisation's overall goals and that you are not accidentally creating Perverse Incentives for some teams. For example, an Operations team might be measured by the uptime of services or the number of reported incidents. This could incentivise the team to value stability to the detriment of other teams who are trying to regularly deliver value with new software.</p>
    <p>Encourage face-to-face communication, using conference and video calls if necessary. Place less importance on comprehensive documentation and tools like document management systems. Consider using tools like Wikis and chat applications to make documentation more collaborative when it is necessary.</p>
    <p>Coach your leaders and managers away from the command and control style of management towards the servant leadership style.</p>
