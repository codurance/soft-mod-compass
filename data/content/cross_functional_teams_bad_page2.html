    <p>A lack of knowledge sharing and collaboration leads to unnecessary delays, defects and rework as key information is not available to the people who need it, when they need it. This is exacerbated when workflow is constrained by employees waiting for key knowledge or stakeholders to become available.</p>
    <p>The heavy specialisation in your existing teams leads to huge drops in productivity as the remaining team members are unable to cover the work of team members who are unavailable due to annual leave, sick leave or even leaving the organisation.</p>
    <p>Consider making changes to your recruitment process to identify and hire team members with experience of different industries, working methods, technologies and specialisations with the goal of creating diversity of thought within the organisation.</p>
    <p>Take steps to break down silos and encourage knowledge sharing between teams. Try having teams deliver workshops on their specialisation to others, or temporary team member exchanges to build a shared understanding of how the entire organisation works.</p>
    <p>Ensure that the goals and metrics of the various teams are aligned to the organisation's overall goals and that you are not accidentally creating Perverse Incentives for some teams. For example, an Operations team might be measured by the uptime of services or the number of reported incidents. This could incentivise the team to value stability to the detriment of other teams who are trying to regularly deliver value with new software.</p>
    <p>Encourage face-to-face communication, using conference and video calls if necessary. Place less importance on comprehensive documentation and tools like document management systems. Consider using tools like Wikis and chat applications to make documentation more collaborative when it is necessary.</p>
    <p>Coach your leaders and managers away from the command and control style of management towards the servant leadership style.</p>
