    <p>A strong continuous delivery pipeline implies that you are able to deploy changes to your production environment multiple times a day, with a greater than 99% success rate. Your deployments should be fully automated and robust, and you are able to recover quickly if something goes wrong, with little to no customer impact.</p>
    <p>In the medium term, your release rate of defects to production should effectively be zero owing to a strong culture of quality (driven by test-driven development) within your teams. Your developers will have the confidence to add features without breaking other parts of the system as unintended side effects are practically unheard of.</p>
    <p>At this stage, production deployments are not a major event - people barely even have to think about them. In delivery terms, “done” and “deployed” are the same thing.</p>
    <p>You will have confidence in the quality of your product, and will be able to regularly release high-value updates to your users with no major technical ceremony.</p>
    <p>You lack of unexpected defects will lead to rapid, predictable delivery cycles.</p>
    <p>Continue to investigate and run experiments on new and better ways to reduce deployment risk and increase feature-delivery cadence.</p>
    <p>Consider looking into the active vandalism approach - destructively test your production systems, then put measure into place to recover from those tests.</p>
