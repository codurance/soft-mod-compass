    <p>It appears that you may currently at a stage in the organisational maturity spectrum that many organisations find difficult to break out of and improve upon. It is likely that external stakeholders (for example, operations and security teams), are involved in your software development lifecycle (if you have one defined), but only towards the end of the process. It is also common in these cases that only a subset of these teams have any real involvement in the SDLC, and that other areas of the business are either rarely involved or involved at the incorrect time.</p>
    <p>We tend to find these scenarios occurring when organisational politics has some influence on decision making across the SDLC, thus not allowing for the most optimal decision-making strategy to be followed in most situations. Perhaps you have noticed that you have a growing amount of technical debt that should be addressed, but you feel you are unable to get it under control owing to commitments that you feel you cannot break? In the worst cases, you may find that your levels of technical debt are continuing to grow and to have more of an effect on business operations, but you cannot find the time or budget to bring it under control.</p>
    <p>You will probably be finding that key requirements from external stakeholders often arrive late, and are sometimes even misunderstood. This interruption of flow (in addition to the need for whole teams to context switch and understand new requirements) often causes large delays in development projects. You may find your ROI on projects dropping, and start to perceive threats from your more agile competition.</p>
    <p>A often-felt point felt at this level is an increase in development lead teams, as well as a feeling of unpredictability. This is often despite starting out with some quick initial progress. Quality issues in your products may start arising owing to increased pressure and inflexible timeframes, causing reputational and monetary damage. The keyword here is “unpredictable”. You will find that you are able to occasionally produce excellent work, but not in a repeatable way that keeps all key stakeholders happy.</p>
    <p>Move towards merging subject matter experts (from business, development, security and operations) into a single team from the start of the project if possible. This allows the whole team instant access to experts when needed, rather than waiting for lengthy proposal responses and domain terms and understanding being lost in translation. An early focus on value discovery and measurements for projects and features should help you to add some form of repeatability and predictability to your product delivery. Approaching feature requests and new projects using the Lean mindset of experimentation and evolution is a good first step here.</p>
    <p>A focus on upskilling your people should help to slow down, or even eliminate, the creation of technical debt. Giving developers the time to clean up prioritized technical debt lists will allow them to build on a more stable, simple base going forwards. We can recommend investigating practices such as eXtreme Programming (XP), Scrum and the Kanban lean approach to make incremental improvements to your delivery process over time.</p>
