    <p>It seems that there may be a broadly-accepted desire to be transparent in your organisation, but some execution is lacking (perhaps for historical reasons). Typically in this scenario, we find a request-response model of information flow which requires employees to actively seek out information.</p>
    <p>Team skill levels may be holding your organisation’s progress back, and a restrictive training budget may exacerbate this situation. An expectation or reliance on staff members learning in their own time will also hold teams back from achieving to their maximum potential.</p>
    <p>At this level there is generally no direct punishment for failure, but not all possible learning outcomes are extracted from failures.</p>
    <p>Career paths may be defined, but tend to be a bit fuzzy and perhaps overly competitive. Career opportunities may be limited by the need for a position to open up before progression and individual progression may be capped for those who are not interested in moving into management positions.</p>
    <p>A sense of frustration over the difficulty of obtaining supposedly open information leads to employees simply not bothering to search for it. This can lead to mistakes owing to misinformed people and non-deliberate information hiding. Information sharing requests may at best be treated with low priority, at worst they may fall on deaf ears.</p>
    <p>A lack of training budget and availability leads to a lack of specialists and a general sense of lethargy regarding self- and organisational- improvement. Highly driven employees may lose morale and seek out alternative employment at learning-driven organisations.</p>
    <p>Hidden failures (from individual to organisational level) leads to employees making the same mistakes repeatedly, when they could be learning for openly discussed, documented past failures. Something about wasted resources.</p>
    <p>One of the greatest danger of a glass ceiling (especially for those who do not wish to pursue careers in management) is the loss of your most senior people. If it is easier to progress by leaving the organisation than by progressing internally, your competitors will gladly hire your best senior technical staff members.</p>
    <p>Find transparency bottlenecks and actively remove them - speak to your employees to understand what is blocking their access to information. Work on moving towards a publish-subscribe model of information dissemination (using appropriate tooling).</p>
    <p>Set aside budget for training and optimise and encourage a culture of learning. Consider kicking off initiatives such as lunch-and-learns, open spaces, unconferences and company-supported learning time. Make sure that your training initiatives are directed towards learnings that improve both employee knowledge and productivity.</p>
    <p>Put an emphasis on incident retrospectives and post-incident root-cause analysis. Make sure that you have constructive feedback mechanisms in place that seek to emphasise learning and avoid placing blame.</p>
    <p>Clarify your requirements and progression plans for the roles in your organisation. Make sure to remove progression bottlenecks, and to understand each individual’s career goals and aspirations. Ensure that your progression plans allow technical people to progress as far as non-technical people.</p>
