    <p>While your teams do, eventually, have access to all the information they need to do their work they may find themselves delayed by having to go through gatekeepers that slow this access down or introduce noise into the signal that the team is after. This can cause significant delays if it is not possible for teams to hold direct conversations with knowledgeable stakeholders and instead have to work through a gatekeeper. </p>    
    <p>Your teams are probably also struggling with other constraints on access to important stakeholders, such as their overall availability or their location. This results in domain experts becoming a constraint on value delivery, and the loss of these experts is a significant organisational risk.</p>
    <p>We recommend delegating full authority on tooling, process and technology to the people who are best qualified to make those decisions. Provide budgetary constraints if absolutely necessary, but trust your team members to make the right decisions.</p>
    <p>Start forming cross-functional teams (if you have not already) and ensure that they are truly cross-functional by including all the skills necessary for them to deliver their product. This will probably involve adding competencies to some teams that are not normally considered part of a software development team, such as marketing, customer support or graphic design as well as more standard roles like developer, QA and system operations.</p>
    <p>Facilitate rapid access to stakeholders for teams. Team members should be able to speak directly with whoever they need to, from customer to CEO, without going through a gatekeeper or mediator. The goal is to reduce delays and rework by ensuring teams have access to people and information on demand.</p>
    <p>Facilitate knowledge sharing sessions, run by domain experts, for your teams. These can include workshops, subject matter training, shadowing and introductions to techniques like Domain Driven Design. Work to turn development teams into domain experts in order to reduce their dependence on external knowledge sources, and to increase their capability to act autonomously.</p>
