    <p>You are part of a high-performing software development organisation. Development teams ship high quality products with fast feature lead times and very low defect rates. Every feature you ship is test driven from customer-perspective acceptance tests through to low level unit tests. Your teams refactor code continuously on an as-needed basis.</p>
    <p>Working conditions are excellent. Teams are motivated and happy and work at a sustainable pace, resulting in a continuous flow of fully peer reviewed deliverables. Pair programming and mob programming are completely unremarkable activities, and teams regularly engage in both.</p>
    <p>Your development teams consistently produce well designed, clean code. Adding new team members has a negligible ramp-up time, code is easy to change and, as a result, it's easy and deliver business value quickly. Critical organisational, technology and domain knowledge is distributed throughout your teams. You are never dependent on the knowledge of any one individual, and as a result your teams are more creative and innovative.</p>
    <p>Defects that escape into the wild are almost unheard of, black swan events. When they do happen they are detected and fixed quickly. As a consequence, both your products and your organisation have a solid reputation.</p>
    <p>Your organisation promotes a good work/life balance for its team members. Morale, motivation and staff retention is high and you are a sought-after place for developers to work.</p>
