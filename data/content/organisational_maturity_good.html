    <p>Your organisation probably no longer has teams dedicated to specific functions and is instead built around persistent, cross-functional teams that can deliver a variety of different products and projects.</p>
    <p>You are able to accurately measure the value provided by the software that you produce using a well-defined and well-understood process that runs from ideation all the way to delivery and operations.</p>
    <p>Reckless technical debt is almost unheard of and prudent technical debt is recorded, visible and addressed pragmatically during ongoing development.</p>
    <p>As a highly mature organisation, monitoring of your products is deep and robust, and in the rare cases where problems occur they are immediately detected, diagnosed and rapidly resolved.</p>
    <p>The majority of your new features deliver measurable value to your customers, and you spend the majority of your development time building new, high-value features delivered at a predictable cadence. As a result your organisation enjoys an enviable reputation in the marketplace.</p>
    <p>Once you are at this level it should be relatively simple to optimise decision making regarding technical debt and calculating the ROI on its resolution.</p>
    <p>Your next objective should be in mentoring and training your team members to be cross-functional, T-shaped people. Strive to grow culture of learning and  continuous improvement.</p>
    <p>You should be pushing towards tighter feedback loops, and trying approaches such as hypothesis testing, growth hacking and innovation accounting.</p>
