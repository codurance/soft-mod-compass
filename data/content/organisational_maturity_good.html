    <p>At this stage you should be finding that there is little-to-no distinction between your development, operations and security teams. They will have merged (or be close to merging) into a single, cross-functional team.</p>
    <p>Your value discovery process is able both measure and prove value from the software you deliver, using a well-defined and understood end-to-end delivery process which runs from ideation all the way measurement of success.</p>
    <p>At this stage technical debt should be minimal to zero. Technical debt may be knowingly taken on based purely on a cost/benefit approach, and is logged and visible. Strategically accruing technical debt is something you are prepared to do as long as the resolution thereof is treated with the same importance level as feature delivery.</p>
    <p>At this highly mature organization point, you should find that your monitoring is deep and robust, and that in the rare cases where problems occur they are immediately detected, diagnosed and resolved.</p>
    <p>The majority of your new features deliver true measurable business value, and you spend the majority of your development time building new, high-value, predictably-delivered features. Regularly releasing valuable features and completed products is a hallmark of high organisational maturity.</p>
    <p>Once you have achieved the goal of cross-functional teams, your next objective should be in mentoring and training your team members to be cross-functional, T-shaped people. A culture of learning and constant learning and improvement should permeate your organisation.</p>
    <p>You should also be pushing towards tighter feedback loops and trying out novel approaches such as growth hacking, innovation accounting and hypothesis testing.</p>
    <p>Once you are at this level it should be relatively simple to optimise decision making regarding technical debt and calculating the ROI on its resolution.</p>
