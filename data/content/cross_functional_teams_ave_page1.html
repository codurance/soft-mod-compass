    <p>Your organisation is trying to work in a more collaborative fashion. Where functional teams exist they work together in a spirit of cooperation towards shared goals and silos are rarely a problem. You may also have started to build cross-functional teams for specific products, but they still might be struggling to shake the functional organisation mindset or may still be dependant on a small number of specialists in other teams.</p>
    <p>Your teams have some flexibility in choosing ways of working, tools and technologies but are probably still tightly constrained in at least one of these dimensions. They also have access to the information they need to do their work, but often this access is not immediate. Technical knowledge is openly shared within your teams but domain knowledge is not as widely shared.</p>
    <p>You probably have some constraints in place that are preventing teams from using the best tools for the job or are compelled to continue to use outdated technologies in some circumstances. This is probably impacting both their productivity and their ability to innovate. It could well also be having an impact on morale as individuals lack autonomy in their working environment and possibly worry about falling behind industry trends in technology and tooling. Unfortunately this situation is probably having a visible impact on staff retention and makes recruiting new team members more difficult.</p>
    <p>While your teams do, eventually, have access to all the information they need to do their work they may find themselves delayed by having to go through gatekeepers that slow this access down or introduce noise into the signal that the team is after. This can cause significant delays if it is not possible for teams to hold direct conversations with knowledgeable stakeholders and instead have to work through a gatekeeper. </p>
