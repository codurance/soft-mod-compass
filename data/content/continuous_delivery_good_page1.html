    <p>A strong continuous delivery pipeline implies that you are able to deploy changes to your production environment multiple times a day with a greater than 99% success rate. Your deployments are fully automated and robust and you are able to recover quickly if something goes wrong with little to no customer impact.</p>
    <p>In the medium term, the rate of defects released into production is effectively zero owing to a strong culture of quality driven by the use of XP practices within your teams.</p>
    <p>Production deployments are not a major event. People barely even have to think about them. In delivery terms, "done", "deployed" and "released" are the same thing. Your developers will have the confidence to add features without breaking other parts of the system as unintended side effects are practically unheard of.</p>
    <p>You will have confidence in the quality of your product, and will be able to regularly release high-value updates to your users with no major technical ceremony. In other words, your lack of unexpected defects will lead to rapid, predictable delivery cycles.</p>
    <p>Continue to innovate and run experiments on new and better ways to reduce deployment risk and increase feature-delivery cadence.</p>
    <p>Experiment with adopting chaos engineering, as popularised by Netflix and their simian army tools, to continuously test your production systems for resilience and quality of service.</p>
