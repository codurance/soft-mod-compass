    <p>A culture of hiding or misrepresenting failures (individual and organisational) results in the same mistakes being repeated over and over, when a culture of honest feedback and learning would have corrected the root cause.</p>
    <p>One of the greatest dangers of a glass ceiling (especially for those who do not wish to pursue careers in management) is the loss of your most senior people. If it is easier to progress by leaving the organisation then your competitors will gladly hire your best technical staff members.</p>
    <p>Find transparency bottlenecks and actively remove them - speak to your employees to understand what is blocking their access to information. Work on moving towards a publish-subscribe model of information dissemination.</p>
    <p>Set aside budget for training and optimise and encourage a culture of learning. Consider kicking off initiatives such as lunch-and-learns, open spaces, unconferences and company-supported learning time. Make sure that your training initiatives are directed towards learnings that improve both employee knowledge and capability..</p>
    <p>Put an emphasis on incident retrospectives and root-cause analysis. Make sure that you have constructive feedback mechanisms in place that emphasise learning and continuous improvement rather than blame and punishment.</p>
    <p>Clarify the career development path for every role in your organisation. Make sure to remove progression bottlenecks and to understand each individual's career goals and aspirations. Ensure that your progression plans allow technical people to progress as far as non-technical people.</p>
