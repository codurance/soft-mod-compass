    <p>It appears that currently your organisation places little to no value on XP practices. test-driven development is just not valued, too difficult to do in your current environment or in the worst case actively discouraged. Similarly, pair programming just doesn't happen, and may even be outright prohibited. This attitude probably extends to peer review of deliverables in general.</p>
    <p>It's probable that your current development efforts have frequent deadline panics or crunch periods that result in large amounts of unpaid overtime from team members, possibly even to the point of cancelling or postponing annual leave.</p>
    <p>Your organisation's code is probably in a bad way. It seems like every change introduces a new defect, often in a completely different area to the one that was changed. Too many defects escape into production, many of them caused by simple mistakes or oversights that could easily have been caught and rectified earlier, and all of them take a long time to fix. You feel like you are constantly firefighting and bug fixing, and all the time your organisation or product's reputation is falling as fast as your level of technical debt is rising.</p>
    <p>If sustained periods of crunch or overtime are common it is only compounding your technical and delivery problems, as well as creating a unpleasant work environment. You regularly lose team members due to the poor morale caused by the low quality levels as well as to frustration and sheer burnout. This creates a negative feedback loop as the remaining team members struggle to cover increasing gaps in organisational, technical and domain knowledge</p>
    <p>First of all you need to identify the areas where legacy code, weak development practices and overall low quality are hurting your organisation the most, so that remediation efforts can be focused where they will bring the most immediate benefit.</p>
    <p>You also need to ensure that the entire organisation is aware of the consequences of the current approach to software development and is committed to continuous improvement in general, and to employing XP practices specifically to improve the software development effort.</p>
