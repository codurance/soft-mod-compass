    <p>You are part of a high performing software development organisation. Development teams ship high quality products with fast feature lead times and very low defect rates. Every feature you ship is test driven from customer perspective acceptance tests through to low level unit tests. Your teams refactor code continuously on an as-needed basis.</p>
    <p>Working conditions are good. Teams are motivated and happy and  work at a sustainable pace, resulting in a continuous flow of fully peer reviewed deliverables. Pair and mob programming are completely unremarkable, and teams regularly engage in both.</p>
    <p>Your development teams consistently produce well designed, clean code. Adding new team members has a negligible ramp up time, code is easy to change and as a result its easy and fast to deliver business value. Critical organisation, technology and domain knowledge is distributed throughout your teams. You are never dependent on the knowledge of any one individual, and your teams are more creative and innovative.</p>
    <p>Defects that escape into the wild are almost unheard of, black swan events. When they do happen, they are detected and fix quickly and as a consequence both your products and your organisation have a solid reputation.</p>
    <p>Your organisation promotes a good work/life balance for its development team members. Morale and motivation and staff retention is high and your are a sought after place for developers to work.</p>
    <p>At this level your organisation is much more of a leader than a follower. Our first recommendation would be to share your experience and knowledge with the wider community by hosting events, writing blog posts and encouraging your team members to speak at events organised by others.</p>
    <p>Encourage your teams to experiment. Use techniques like 20% time and hack days to work on new ways of working, feature ideas and maybe products.</p>
    <p>Where it is appropriate, consider whether you can export the principles that underlie XP into other parts of your organisation to help them to improve.</p>
