    <p>Your deployment processes are either entirely or mostly manual, and that there tends to be a blurred line of accountability between operations and development teams. Deployments to non-production environments are often automated, but production deployments remain manual.</p>
    <p>A large percentage of development time is spent reworking defects that escape into the production environment, pulling developers' attention away from newer, valuable components and features. This leads to risk-aversity amongst developers owing to unpredictable side effects.</p>
    <p>Operational problems owing to human error are commonplace - important things may get missed or omitted owing to fuzzy accountability between development and operations teams.</p>
    <p>Deployment issues and rollbacks typically lead to a lower deployment cadence and slower time to market. When promised features fail top appear to clients, reputational damage follows and clients may look to other vendors to meet their needs.</p>
    <p>The combination of defect resolution and slow feature development lead times inevitably increases the cost of getting new features to market owing to fear-based over-engineering and risk-averse behaviour in development teams. This is a typical cause of developer frustration and staff turnover.</p>
